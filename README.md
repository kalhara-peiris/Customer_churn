# üìâ Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning models. The primary goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain them.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The project utilizes a customer churn dataset (`customer_churn.csv`) to train and evaluate the prediction models.

## üîç Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   The dataset is explored to understand its structure, identify patterns, and check for class imbalance.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - The `customerID` column is dropped.  
   - Missing values in `TotalCharges` (where tenure is 0) are handled by removing those rows.

3. **Model Building**  
   Various machine learning classifiers are trained on the preprocessed data, including:
   - Random Forest
   - AdaBoost
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost
   - LightGBM
   - Gaussian Naive Bayes
   - K-Nearest Neighbors
   - Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
   - CatBoost
   - Voting Classifier
   - Stacking Classifier
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   The models are evaluated using metrics like:
   - Accuracy
   - F1-score
   - Classification report

5. **Model Interpretability**  
   SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the model's predictions and understand the influence of different features on churn.

## üìä Results

The project identifies key features that influence customer churn and provides insights into how these features interact.

SHAP analysis reveals that:
- Contract type
- Charges
- Payment method
- Tech support
- Online security
- Internet service
- Monthly charges  
are significant predictors of churn.
